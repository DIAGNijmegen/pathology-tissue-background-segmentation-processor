# Tissue-Background Segmentation of Histopathological Whole-Slide Images

In this project we collected 100 + 8 whole-slide images (WSIs) for development and testing of a fully-convolutional neural network (FCNN) that can distinguish between tissue and background areas on the WSIs.

This repository contains all the code and model weights required to run the model.
